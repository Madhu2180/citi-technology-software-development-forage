This repository showcases my work from the **Citi Technology Software Development Virtual Experience** completed on [Forage]  
The program involved real-world inspired tasks focused on improving Citi’s loan management system and stock market risk reporting through software engineering and data visualization.

---

## 💼 Program Summary
Throughout the simulation, I worked on a series of software development tasks designed to apply **Java programming**, **UML modeling**, **API integration**, and **data visualization** in a financial technology context.
1. Completed a job simulation involving hypothetical tasks to improve Citi's loan management system and stock market risk reporting.
2. Created a state diagram of the loan management process using the Unified Modeling Language (UML). 
3. Researched potential machine learning systems to assess credit risk and provided recommendations for next steps. 
4. Used Java to build an internal tool visualizing stock market risk in real time.

## 🧠 Tasks Overview

### 🔹 Task 1 – Create a State Diagram
- Designed a **UML state diagram** for the loan management process.  
- Represented loan initiation, approval, disbursement, and repayment states.  
- Helped visualize system behavior and process flow for efficiency.

### 🔹 Task 2 – Write a Feature Proposal
- Proposed a **new machine learning-based feature** for credit risk assessment.  
- Conducted research on model selection and implementation strategies.  
- Outlined benefits, feasibility, and next steps for system integration.

### 🔹 Task 3 – Query Data from the Web
- Utilized the **Yahoo Finance API** to fetch real-time stock market data.  
- Developed a **Java program** to query, parse, and store data efficiently.  
- Practiced exception handling and API-driven data retrieval.

### 🔹 Task 4 – Visualize Live Data
- Built a **JavaFX application** to display live stock price changes.  
- Implemented a **dynamic line chart** that updates every few seconds.  
- Demonstrated real-time data visualization and event-driven programming.
